# Credit Card Fraud Detection
### Machine Learning module of Machine Learning and Decision Models course
#### Universit√† degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, a.a. 2020-2021

### Project Description
Project work for the exam of Machine Learning, based on Kaggle dataset Credit Card Fraud Detection.  
The dataset can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
Our aim is to build a Machine Learning model (through a KNIME workflow) that can predict if a transaction is fraudolent or not, taking into account that we also have to reduce false positive (in the form of service interruption for our customers).  
To achieve this, we also have to address the problem of the unbalanced data with oversampling algorithms.

### Software
The entire project was made with [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/)
