### Project Description
Project work for the exam of Data Management and Data Visualization.  
The aim of the project is to study, through indicators and tweets, the socioeconomic situation of 36 chosen nations and their approach to climate change.  

The first part, dedicated to Data Management module, begins with the choice of **V**elocity (tweets streaming from Twitter) and **V**ariety (data integration from another source), among the 3 **V** of Big Data, for the creation of the dataset.  
Tweets are gathered with tweepy API and socioeconomic indicators are taken from [WorldBank](https://www.worldbank.org).  
After the data enrichment, it is rearranged with a document and loaded on a MongoDB shard.

The second part, dedicated to Data Visualization module, is the creation of a story through visualization in Tableau, available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alberto.carlone/viz/Earthday-ProgettoDMDVCarloneMioriOndei/Storia1).
