# Il Problema dei Dati Mancanti
### Course of High Dimensional Data Analysis
#### Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, a.a. 2021-2022

### Project Description
Project work for the exam of High Dimensional Data Analysis, based on chapter 8 of “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models” by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson.  
The aim of the project is to address the problem of missing values from different perspective. Starting from the available R scripts, we combined what we learned from the lessons to improve the analysis already present in the book.

### Libraries and R version:
- RStudio
- (to be added..)

### Datasets
- stations.RData and chicago_raw_entries.RData are available in this repository and on the [authors GitHub page](https://github.com/topepo/FES/tree/master/08_Handling_Missing_Data)
- scat dataset is available directly in R
